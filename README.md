# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)


"This project focuses on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic challenge in combinatorial optimization. The goal is to find the shortest path connecting a predefined set of cities, ensuring that each city is visited exactly once and the salesman returns to the starting point. Through this project, I present an innovative approach to solving the TSP using the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm, alongside optimization algorithms and efficient programming techniques. My aim is to provide a robust and adaptable solution to this fundamental problem while offering an open platform for collaboration and continuous improvement."
