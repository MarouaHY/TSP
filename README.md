# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)


"The Traveling Salesman Problem Solver focuses on the classic challenge of solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization. The goal is to find the shortest path connecting a set of predefined cities, ensuring that each city are visited once and the seller returns to the starting point. Our project provides an innovative way to solve TSP using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and other optimization techniques, where the user can input the city distance and visualize the problem using a 3D chart. The interface uses KNN to calculate the optimal trip and display the trip and its total distance. This interactive tool provides TSP with a simple solution and provides insights into the optimization process while providing a platform for collaboration and continuous improvement.‚Äù
